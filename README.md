## Examples
#### Create Workspaces to group repos
```
gk ws create
```
GitKraken workspaces associate groups of repos and set the context for helpful commands that can operate on, or get information for, multiple repos at once. There are two types of workspaces:
##### Local
Local Workspaces exist only on your machine.
##### Cloud
Cloud Workspaces are accessible on any machine, and can be connected to hosting and issue providers like GitHub and GitLab to get additional information about pull requests and issues. Share Cloud Workspaces with your team to improve onboarding with the ability to clone all repos at once. To enable this extra functionality, Cloud Workspaces require a free GitKraken account. We are continuing to evolve and improve GitKraken Workspaces and welcome any feedback.
