## gk workspace add-repo

Add a repository to a workspace

### Synopsis

Add one or more repositories to a workspace by providing their remote URLs or paths to local repos as a single, comma-separated argument. This approach enables you to efficiently add multiple repositories in one command, simply by separating each repository's URL or path with a comma.

```
gk workspace add-repo [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  # Add multiple remote repositories to the current workspace
  $ gk workspace add-repo "https://github.com/user/repo1.git,https://github.com/user/repo2.git"

   # Add multiple local repositories to a specific workspace
  $ gk workspace add-repo "/path/to/repo1,/path/to/repo2"
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help          help for add-repo
  -p, --path string   Specify the path to clone the repository
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -s, --select-ws   Skip the default workspace for this action and force a workspace selection
```
