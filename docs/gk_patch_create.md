## gk patch create

Share changes in your commits or WIP with other developers generating a Cloud Patch

### Synopsis

The Cloud Patches preview feature enables you to easily share changes with other developers by creating a Cloud Patch from your WIP and sharing the generated link with your teammates.

Note: Cloud Patches are securely stored by GitKraken, and anyone with access to the link and a GitKraken account can view the code for now. More permissions and controls are coming soon.
