## gk pr list-suggestions

Search if an open pull request for the current branch exists and displays its Code Suggestions

### Synopsis

Search if an open pull request for the current branch exists and displays its Code Suggestions.
By default, the command searches in your current directory if the checked out branch in your repository has a pull request with Code Suggestions.
To select a pull request from a repository in your workspace directly, use the `-w` flag.
NOTE: If the command fails to detect a pull request or the folder is not a repository, it will fallback to the `-w` option.
