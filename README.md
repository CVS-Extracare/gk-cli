## üíª Installation

`gk` is available as a downloadable binary from the [releases page][]. Then, you only need to add it to your path in the terminal to make it globally available.

### macOS and Unix

Add it to your binaries folder:

```bash
mv ~/Downloads/gk ~/usr/local/bin/gk
``` 

### Windows

Place the `gk` binary in a desired folder. Then edit your environment variables to add it to your PATH.

1. In Search, search for **Environment Variables**.
2. Click on the **Edit the system environment variables** result.
3. In the modal, click on the **Environment Variables...** button.
4. In the **System Variables** section, scroll until you find the **PATH** variable. Click on it.
    - If it doesn't exist, create a variable with the name **PATH**. 
5. Add the path to the `gk` binary at the end.
